# PaySphere AWS Infrastructure

A secure, scalable AWS-based architecture for mobile payment systems, built with **Terraform** and **Python**, designed to meet the demands of modern **FinTech** platforms.

---

## 1. Project Objective
To design and implement a **production-grade cloud infrastructure** for a mobile payment platform that ensures:
- High availability (HA) and resiliency
- Strong security controls (Zero Trust principles)
- Scalable performance for transaction spikes
- Automation for deployment and monitoring

---

## 2. Architecture Overview
The PaySphere infrastructure is based on AWS best practices and includes:
- **VPC** with private and public subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- **EC2** instances for compute workloads (API services, backend processing)
- **S3** for secure storage of static assets and logs
- **RDS/Aurora** for relational database needs
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for fault tolerance
- **CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring
- **KMS** for encryption at rest and in transit

## 5. Security & Compliance
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)  
- **Encryption:** AWS KMS for all sensitive data  
- **Network Segmentation:** Private subnets for backend services  
- **Auditing:** CloudTrail enabled for all critical actions  
- **Compliance Ready:** Designed to align with PCI-DSS requirements
